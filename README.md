# User MBS

It's using MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Architectural Pattern and Data Binding.

For storing data (users, employees, buyers and warehouses), app is using [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room).

It uses [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/), a free, open-source API for generating random user data. Like Lorem Ipsum, but for people.

For working with REST service, app is using [Retrofit2](https://square.github.io/retrofit/).

For working (downloading, displaying and caching) with rendered image, app is using [Picasso](https://square.github.io/picasso/).
